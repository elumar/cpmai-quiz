Phase I: Business Understanding,Determine Business Objectives,Determine Business Objectives,"Which Phase I task defines the specific business problem the AI project will address, stated in business language?",Cognitive Requirements,Determine Business Objectives,Acceptable Model Performance Values,AI Pattern Identification,B,"Determine Business Objectives defines the problem in business-native language — not technical language. It names a business problem, specifies direction of improvement, and is specific enough for stakeholder agreement."
Phase I: Business Understanding,Determine Business Objectives,Determine Business Success Criteria,A well-formed Business Success Criterion must include all of the following EXCEPT:,Baseline and target values,Measurement method and time frame,Algorithm selection and hyperparameters,A named metric,C,"Algorithm selection belongs to Phase IV (Select Modeling Technique). Business Success Criteria include: metric, baseline, target, measurement method, and time frame — all in business language."
Phase I: Business Understanding,Determine Business Objectives,Determine Business Success Criteria,What is the PRIMARY difference between Business Success Criteria and Acceptable KPI Performance Values?,Success Criteria are technical while KPI values are business-level,Success Criteria define aspirational targets while KPI values define the minimum acceptable floor,Success Criteria are set by engineers while KPI values are set by executives,There is no meaningful difference between them,B,Business Success Criteria define what the business aspires to achieve (the target). KPI Performance Values define the minimum acceptable business impact — the floor below which the system does not justify its cost.
Phase I: Business Understanding,Assess Situation,Resource Requirements,"During Phase I Assess Situation, the PM estimates that the project needs 3 ML engineers and $400K in compute. What does this output feed DIRECTLY?",Phase IV Model Training,Phase I AI Go/No-Go Execution Feasibility,Phase II Collect Initial Data,Phase VI Operationalization Plan,B,Assess Situation estimates what resources and schedule are requireExecution Feasibility (under AI Go/No-Go) evaluates whether the organization can actually provide those resources. This is a direct dependency.
Phase I: Business Understanding,AI System Performance and Operation,Acceptable Model Performance Values,A model achieves 94% accuracy (PASSES model performance threshold) but the business KPI shows no improvement. What is the MOST LIKELY explanation?,The model performance values were set incorrectly,The problem is deployment or adoption — not the model itself,The KPI Performance Values were set too high,The Cost-Benefit Analysis was wrong,B,"When a model passes technical thresholds but fails KPI measurement, the gap is typically in deployment, user adoption, or business process change — not in the model. This is the Model PASS / KPI FAIL scenario."

Transparency addresses system-level disclosure (is AI involved, how does it generally work). This is the most commonly confused pair."
Phase I: Business Understanding,Trustworthy AI Requirements,AI Failure Modes,"In Phase I, AI Failure Mode analysis is performed BEFORE the model is built. This makes the analysis:",Reactive — responding to observed failures,Proactive — anticipating failures before they occur,Unnecessary — since no model exists to fail yet,Redundant with Phase VI monitoring,B,"Phase I failure mode analysis is proactive by design. It identifies potential technical, operational, human interaction, and systemic failures before the model is built, so mitigations can be planned into the project from the start."

After documenting the cognitive requirements, the team identifies that these capabilities map to two different AI patterns. One pattern requires labeled historical data; the other requires time-series data with no labels. Which downstream Phase I tasks will be directly affected by this multi-pattern identification?",A. Determine Business Objectives only,"B. Resource Requirements, Schedule Requirements, and Data Feasibility",C. Cost-Benefit Analysis only,D. Produce Project Plan only,B,"Multi-pattern identification affects Resource Requirements (different expertise needed), Schedule Requirements (different timelines per pattern), and Data Feasibility (different data requirements per pattern).

Phase I: Business Understanding,"[Cognitive Project Requirements, Trustworthy AI Requirements]","[Cognitive Requirements, AI Pattern Identification, Required AI Explainability Considerations]","A pharmaceutical company is conducting Phase I for an AI system to predict patient response to experimental cancer therapies. The program manager documents the following: Statement 1: ""The system must predict the probability of tumor reduction >30% within 90 days for each patient based on genomic markers, histopathology images, and prior treatment history."" Statement 2: ""The system must provide the top three genomic features contributing to each patient's prediction."" Statement 3: ""This is a Predictive Analytics pattern with an explainability constraint."" Which statements correctly represent Cognitive Requirements versus other Phase I tasks?",A. Statement 1 is a Cognitive Requirement; Statement 2 is a Cognitive Requirement; Statement 3 is AI Pattern Identification,B. Statement 1 is a Cognitive Requirement; Statement 2 is a Trustworthy AI Requirement; Statement 3 is AI Pattern Identification,C. Statement 1 is Determine Business Success Criteria; Statement 2 is AI Pattern Identification; Statement 3 is Cognitive Requirements,D. Statement 1 is a Cognitive Requirement; Statement 2 is a Cognitive Requirement; Statement 3 is a Cognitive Requirement,B,Statement 1 describes what the AI must do intellectually (Cognitive Requirements). Statement 2 defines explainability (Trustworthy AI Requirement). Statement 3 maps to Predictive Analytics pattern (AI Pattern Identification).
