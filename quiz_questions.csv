"Phase I: Business Understanding","Determine Business Objectives","Determine Business Objectives","Which Phase I task defines the specific business problem the AI project will address, stated in business language?","Cognitive Requirements","Determine Business Objectives","Acceptable Model Performance Values","AI Pattern Identification",B,"Determine Business Objectives defines the problem in business-native language — not technical language. It names a business problem, specifies direction of improvement, and is specific enough for stakeholder agreement."
"Phase I: Business Understanding","Determine Business Objectives","Determine Business Success Criteria","A well-formed Business Success Criterion must include all of the following EXCEPT:","Baseline and target values","Measurement method and time frame","Algorithm selection and hyperparameters","A named metric",C,"Algorithm selection belongs to Phase IV (Select Modeling Technique). Business Success Criteria include: metric, baseline, target, measurement method, and time frame — all in business language."
"Phase I: Business Understanding","Determine Business Objectives","Determine Business Success Criteria","What is the PRIMARY difference between Business Success Criteria and Acceptable KPI Performance Values?","Success Criteria are technical while KPI values are business-level","Success Criteria define aspirational targets while KPI values define the minimum acceptable floor","Success Criteria are set by engineers while KPI values are set by executives","There is no meaningful difference between them",B,"Business Success Criteria define what the business aspires to achieve (the target). KPI Performance Values define the minimum acceptable business impact — the floor below which the system does not justify its cost."
"Phase I: Business Understanding","Assess Situation","Resource Requirements","During Phase I Assess Situation, the PM estimates that the project needs 3 ML engineers and $400K in compute. What does this output feed DIRECTLY?","Phase IV Model Training","Phase I AI Go/No-Go Execution Feasibility","Phase II Collect Initial Data","Phase VI Operationalization Plan",B,"Assess Situation estimates what resources and schedule are required. Execution Feasibility (under AI Go/No-Go) evaluates whether the organization can actually provide those resources. This is a direct dependency."
"Phase I: Business Understanding","AI System Performance and Operation","Acceptable Model Performance Values","A model achieves 94% accuracy (PASSES model performance threshold) but the business KPI shows no improvement. What is the MOST LIKELY explanation?","The model performance values were set incorrectly","The problem is deployment or adoption — not the model itself","The KPI Performance Values were set too high","The Cost-Benefit Analysis was wrong",B,"When a model passes technical thresholds but fails KPI measurement, the gap is typically in deployment, user adoption, or business process change — not in the model. This is the Model PASS / KPI FAIL scenario."
"Phase I: Business Understanding","Trustworthy AI Requirements","Required AI Explainability Considerations","Which Trustworthy AI task answers: 'Why was THIS specific decision made for THIS case?'","Required AI Transparency Considerations","Required Ethical AI Considerations","Required AI Explainability Considerations","AI Failure Modes",C,"Explainability addresses instance-level understanding — why a specific decision was made for a specific case. Transparency addresses system-level disclosure (is AI involved, how does it generally work). This is the most commonly confused pair."
"Phase I: Business Understanding","Trustworthy AI Requirements","AI Failure Modes","In Phase I, AI Failure Mode analysis is performed BEFORE the model is built. This makes the analysis:","Reactive — responding to observed failures","Proactive — anticipating failures before they occur","Unnecessary — since no model exists to fail yet","Redundant with Phase VI monitoring",B,"Phase I failure mode analysis is proactive by design. It identifies potential technical, operational, human interaction, and systemic failures before the model is built, so mitigations can be planned into the project from the start."
"Phase I: Business Understanding","AI Go/No-Go","Execution Feasibility","A Go/No-Go assessment finds strong business case and available data, but the organization lacks ML engineering talent and has no GPU infrastructure. Which feasibility dimension FAILS?","Business Feasibility","Data Feasibility","Execution Feasibility","All three dimensions fail",C,"Execution Feasibility evaluates whether the organization can deliver the project with required resources, skills, infrastructure, and timeline. Skills gaps and infrastructure gaps are execution feasibility failures."
