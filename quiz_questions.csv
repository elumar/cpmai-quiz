Phase I: Business Understanding,Determine Business Objectives,Determine Business Objectives,"Which Phase I task defines the specific business problem the AI project will address, stated in business language?",Cognitive Requirements,Determine Business Objectives,Acceptable Model Performance Values,AI Pattern Identification,B,"Determine Business Objectives defines the problem in business-native language — not technical language. It names a business problem, specifies direction of improvement, and is specific enough for stakeholder agreement."
Phase I: Business Understanding,Determine Business Objectives,Determine Business Success Criteria,A well-formed Business Success Criterion must include all of the following EXCEPT:,Baseline and target values,Measurement method and time frame,Algorithm selection and hyperparameters,A named metric,C,"Algorithm selection belongs to Phase IV (Select Modeling Technique). Business Success Criteria include: metric, baseline, target, measurement method, and time frame — all in business language."
Phase I: Business Understanding,Determine Business Objectives,Determine Business Success Criteria,What is the PRIMARY difference between Business Success Criteria and Acceptable KPI Performance Values?,Success Criteria are technical while KPI values are business-level,Success Criteria define aspirational targets while KPI values define the minimum acceptable floor,Success Criteria are set by engineers while KPI values are set by executives,There is no meaningful difference between them,B,Business Success Criteria define what the business aspires to achieve (the target). KPI Performance Values define the minimum acceptable business impact — the floor below which the system does not justify its cost.
